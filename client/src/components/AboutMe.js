      <label class="title">About Me</label>
      <p>Hi, my name is Lizbeth.  I am a web developer with a passion for learning!</p>
      <p>My background is in physics and for the last decade I have been a science educator teaching just about any science class you could name at the middle and high school levels.</p>
      <p>Doing physics has taught me valuable technical problem-solving skills, while teaching has taught me social skills such as conflict-resolution and how to participate as a valuable team-member.</p>
      <p>I believe that my ability to integrate these skills, along with my patience, organization, and curiousity, make me a great part of any team!</p>
      <p>I love coding and I am absolutely thrilled to be changing careers to this profession!</p>
